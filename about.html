              Situated in Urun-Islampur, within the Walwa Taluka of the Sangli
              district in Southern Maharashtra, lies Yashwantrao Chavan
              College.In pursuit of "Bahujan Hitay, Bahujan Sukhay" (for the
              good of many, for the prosperity of many), the late Shri. S. D.
              Patil(ex-member of parliament), an educationalist and social
              reformer, created it in June 1970. April 1976 saw the college's
              UGC recognition under 20.5f, and June 2005 saw its permanent
              affiliation with Shivaji University, Kolhapur. From the college's
              founding it has provided invaluable assistance in the areas of
              education, athletics, NSS, and cultural events. At the graduate
              level, it offers instruction in business administration, computer
              science, science, arts, and commerce. Additionally, it offers a
              large number of timely Career Orientated Courses (COCs) from
              Shivaji University in Kolhapur and UGC. In order to improve
              education and the welfare of the community, the late Shri. S. D.
              Patil and his associates established the Walwa Taluka Education
              Society in 1945. In Southern Maharashtra, the late Shri. S. D.
              Patil was highly involved in both social and political affairs. He
              was chosen from the Sangli area to serve as the M.L.A., M.P., and
              President of Zillah Parishad.
